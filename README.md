## How to use

To create the notifications you need to use the *Panel.py* file, when you manage your notifications you need to run the *setup.py* file and leave it open in the background and it will send the notifications (at the date and time indicated when creating the notification in the *Panel.py*) to your operating system



*Validations.py* and *Notify.py* are not necessary files for the management of notifications but for the correct functioning of the application

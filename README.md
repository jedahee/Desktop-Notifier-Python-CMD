## Files and folders

DekstopNotifier is composed of 4 .py files and a folder that contains a binary file where it saves the notifications.

### Files

- Panel.py
- Validations.py
- Notify.py
- setup.py

### Folders

- data/
  - notifications.npy



## How to use

To create the notifications you need to use the *Panel.py* file, when you manage your notifications you need to run the *setup.py* file and leave it open in the background and it will send the notifications (at the date and time indicated when creating the notification in the *Panel.py*) to your operating system



*Validations.py* and *Notify.py* are not necessary files for the management of notifications but for the correct functioning of the application
